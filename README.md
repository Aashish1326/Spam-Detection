# Project: Spam Detection
# Algorithm used: Naive Bayes
# Steps followed:

* Applied the Naive Bayes algorithm for building a spam detection machine learning model.
* Utilized a training dataset consisting of labeled SMS messages, where each message is classified as either "Spam" or "Ham" (non-spam).
* Preprocessed the SMS messages by performing tasks like tokenization, removing stop words, and transforming the text data into numerical representations (e.g., using TF-IDF or bag-of-words).
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
* Trained the Naive Bayes model on the training set, allowing it to learn the patterns and characteristics associated with spam and non-spam messages.
* Evaluated the model's accuracy on the testing set, which indicates how well it can predict whether an incoming SMS is spam or ham.
* Achieved an accuracy of 97% on the testing set, showcasing the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages.
